# online_replanner

The repository contains the implementation of an anytime informed path replanner and optimizer (**AIPRO**). The re-planner avoids un-predicted obstacles and/or optimizes the current path switching between pre-computed paths. It is based on Moveit! to get information about the environment.

You can read technical specifications about this replanner [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13245).

## Build/Installation
The software can be installed using rosinstall files.

1. Install ros: follow the steps described in http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation
2. Install wstool and initialize the workspace: follow the steps described in http://wiki.ros.org/wstool
3. Install and configure rosdep: follow the steps described in http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep

Then, download and merge the rosinstall file:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/online_replanner/master/online_replanner.rosinstall
wstool merge -t src ./online_replanner.rosinstall
```
Now, do the same with the dependencies required:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
wget https://bitbucket.org/iras-ind/human_aware_motion_planners/raw/b1d545049aa78ab35e3918e4d30fbc395416ad40/human_aware.rosinstall
wstool merge -t src ./human_aware.rosinstall

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CNR-STIIMA-IRAS/rosdyn/master/rosdyn.rosinstall
wstool merge -t src ./rosdyn.rosinstall
```
Download and install the packages specified in the rosinstall file and the other system dipendencies:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
wstool update -t src
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```
## Packages
### **graph_replanning [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/online_replanner/blob/master/graph_replanning/README.md)**
It contains two main classes:
 1. [replanner](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/online_replanner/blob/master/graph_replanning/include/graph_replanning/replanner.h)
 2. [replanner_manager](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/online_replanner/blob/master/graph_replanning/include/graph_replanning/replanner_manager.h)

 replanner_manager executes the robot motion and, in the meanwhile, it continuously replans, calling several times the replanner.

### **graph_replanning_examples [see README](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/online_replanner/blob/master/graph_replanning_examples/README.md)**
It contains some useful examples of usage of the replanner and replanner manager. It provides also a base on which run the replanner and/or the replanner manager on your robotic cell.

## Work in progress
AIPRO is continuosly evolving. If you find errors or if you have some suggestions, [please let us know](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/online_replanner/issues).
